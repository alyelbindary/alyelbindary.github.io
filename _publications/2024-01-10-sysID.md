Introduction
===

In this project, we will be working with a 2DOF hover called Aero2, manufactured by Quanser. The aim of the project is to put into practice different system identification methods in order to be able to determine a model that can describe the hover. This is an important process, since before developing controllers in order to perform a specific task, we need to have a model on which we can design this controller. 

We will start off by describing the working principle of the hover and its specifics, in order to properly describe the project goals. Then we will dive into the theoretical concepts that will be employed in order to achieve these goals. Finally, we will go through the different results that we have obtained in order to identify the different models.
