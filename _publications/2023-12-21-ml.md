Abstract
===

Twitter serves as a dynamic platform for individuals to freely and vividly articulate their thoughts. Consequently, there exists a considerable interest in efficiently gauging the sentiment conveyed in Tweets without the need for laborious manual inspection. This research project endeavors to address this challenge by focusing on the classification of tweets into positive or negative sentiment categories. To achieve this objective, a comprehensive approach is employed, leveraging multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The methods employed include logistic regression, word embeddings, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and the renowned transformers architecture.
