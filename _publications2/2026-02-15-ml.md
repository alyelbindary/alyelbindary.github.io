Introduction
===

Injectable biomaterials have been proposed for volume restoration following implantation [1, 2]. In preclinical studies these materials are delivered subcutaneously in small-animal models, where longitudinal monitoring is essential to evaluate their volume. Reliable volumetric quantification, however, remains challenging. Caliper measurements, though common, capture only superficial dimensions and often misestimate true implant size. Recent work has demonstrated pipelines for automatic segmentation of implants on T2-weighted MRI [3], yet this contrast is limited by fat contamination and chemical shift artifacts that obscure boundaries. Dixon imaging, by separating water and fat signals, generates component-specific reconstructions that enhance implant conspicuity and provide a reproducible basis for reliable segmentation and volumetric analysis.
