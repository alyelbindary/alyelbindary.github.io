Hey there! Welcome to my personal website where you'll find a bit of my achievements, academic journey and work experience. My name is Aly Elbindary and I'm currently completing my Master's in [Robotics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/) along with a minor in Data Science, at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne [(EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

I received my Bachelor of Science (BSc) in [Microengineering](https://www.epfl.ch/education/bachelor/programs/microengineering/) at EPFL where I had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of topics such as programming, digital systems design and mechanical design to name a few.
